This is the buildsystem for the LEDE Linux distribution.

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your preferred
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.

Install Dependencies

Entware-ng uses OpenWrt Buildroot, please install its dependencies (=step 1, without subversion mercurial) first.
Clone repo

git clone https://github.com/Entware-ng/Entware-ng.git
cd Entware-ng

Update package feeds

make package/symlinks

Pick up one of supported platform

...by copying buildroot config file from configs folder. Example below uses MIPS platform config:

cp configs/mipselsf.config .config

Rebuild repo

make 

Please refer OpenWrt buildroot documentation for more details.
Tips

You can build one package (squid in example) with all its dependencies by:

make package/squid/compile

If something goes wrong, turn on verbose mode by adding V=s:

make package/tmux/compile V=s

You can speed up compilation on multiprocessor systems by running several build threads simultaneously by adding -jN:

make -j4 package/compile

You can run make in several steps

make tools/install
make toolchain/install
make target/compile
make package/compile

This can also be used in case you don't need to build all packages. Replace the last command with the command to build the package you need.
Error in tools or toolchain

In case there is an error in the tools/install or toolchain/install phase, and you do change your configuration, remember to run a make dirclean instead of make clean. To clean only one specific part you can run a make toolchain/uClibc/headers/clean for example.
